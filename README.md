## Features

- **Experience Level Slider**: Set your experience level from 0-10+ years
- **Real-time Filtering**: Jobs are filtered instantly as you browse
- **Visual Dimming**: Non-matching jobs are dimmed but remain accessible
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects experience requirements in job descriptions
- **Persistent Settings**: Your preferences are saved across sessions
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional popup interface
- **Accessibility**: Filtered jobs remain clickable and keyboard navigable

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `job-experience-filter` folder
5. The extension icon will appear in your Chrome toolbar

## Usage

1. Navigate to LinkedIn Jobs (https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/)
2. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
3. Use the experience slider to set your desired experience level
4. Toggle filtering on/off as needed
5. Jobs that don't match your criteria will be dimmed

## Experience Level Mapping

- **0-1 years**: Internship positions
- **0-2 years**: Entry level positions
- **2-4 years**: Associate level positions
- **4-8 years**: Mid-Senior level positions
- **8+ years**: Director and executive positions

## How It Works

The extension analyzes job listings using:
- Job titles and descriptions
- Experience requirements mentioned in text
- Common keywords and patterns
- Years of experience specified

Jobs are filtered based on your selected experience level with a tolerance range to ensure relevant opportunities aren't missed.

## Privacy

- No data is collected or transmitted
- All filtering happens locally in your browser
- Settings are stored locally using Chrome's storage API
- No external servers or analytics

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (Manifest V3)
- Chromium-based browsers (Edge, Brave, etc.)
