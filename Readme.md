# 🧩 Fresher Job Filter – Chrome Extension
Hello everyone, I am a fresher and job hunting is quite tough I know that now. In today's market there are jobs who refer only experienced ones even though the job title feels like it's for the freshers.

Hence, I came up with this idea of creating a web extension which helps us to filter out the required experience. This will save us time to prepare for the future opportunities, upskill ourselves and build new projects that will help us get a job. 

Why a chrome extension? Cause this saves time and will help others like me also I can add it on my portfolio as it's good project and solves real-world problems.
